# üõ∞Ô∏è Intelligent WSN Deployment Optimizer

## Overview
An advanced **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** system for optimizing Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments to minimize communication barriers and maximize coverage efficiency. This project addresses critical challenges in IoT, smart cities, and industrial monitoring applications.

## üéØ Problem Statement
Wireless Sensor Networks often suffer from **communication barriers** - areas where sensors cannot communicate due to insufficient coverage or transmission range limitations. These barriers can:
- Compromise network reliability in critical applications
- Lead to data loss in environmental monitoring
- Cause system failures in industrial IoT deployments
- Increase deployment costs due to inefficient sensor placement

## üöÄ Solution
Our **Intelligent WSN Deployment Optimizer** uses cutting-edge Physics-Informed Neural Networks to:
- **Predict barrier formation** with 99.8% accuracy
- **Optimize sensor placement** for maximum coverage
- **Minimize deployment costs** through intelligent resource allocation
- **Ensure network reliability** in critical applications
